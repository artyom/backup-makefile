backup makefile
===============

I use this Makefile for about a year for backing up my homedir to external usb
drive weekly. It creates separate folder for each date's backup, like
`backup-YYYY-MM-DD`, hardlinking unchanged files from previous copy, thus only
changed files use extra space on each run.

Feel free to use/modify it. rsync 3 is suggested.
